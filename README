HTTP-Cache-Transparent version 0.4
============================

HTTP::Cache::Transparent is an implementation of http get that keeps a local 
cache of fetched pages to avoid fetching the same data from the server 
if it hasn't been updated. The cache is stored on disk and is thus 
persistent between invocations.

The http-headers If-Modified-Since and ETag are used to let the server
decide if the version in the cache is up-to-date or not.

HTTP::Cache::Transparent was initially called HTTP::TransparentCache. It
was renamed on request from modules@perl.org.
